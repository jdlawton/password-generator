JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

For this challenge I took the provided starter code and built a JavaScript application that would prompt the user for a series of password criteria and then generate a random password based on those criteria. The newly generated password was then displayed in the page's textbox.

- Clicking on the Generate Password button will cause the user to be presented with a series of prompts, including:
    - Size of password (between 8 and 128 characters)
    - Do they want lowercase letters
    - Do they want uppercase letters
    - Do they want numeric characters
    - Do they want special characters
- The user's input is validated to ensure the size is within range and that at least one character set has been selected.
- The program then generates a random password using the supplied criteria and displays the resulting new password in the page's textbox.
